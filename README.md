# Session_3_Lists_and_Loops

For this session we read through the appropriate chapter **(Chapter 4: Lists and Loops)** in the **Python for Biologist** book.

We then met online to discuss how we fared in the exercises at the end of the chapter.

Thereafter we went through some additional Theory and Exercises.

**Launch** the Interactive Jupyter notebook HERE -> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Bioinformatics-studyclub/Session_3_Lists_and_Loops/main)


INSTRUCTIONs:

In order for the interactive notebook above to run all the blocks without errors:
1. you need to make sure that the files that are used, are stored in the appropriate directories. 
2. So save a copy of the **dna.txt**, **genomic_dna.txt** and the **input.txt** files on your personal Desktop. 
3. Also change the file path to your OWN file path wherever you see a file path for "tracey"
E.g. /home/Cathy_Jones/Desktop, in every block where this file is supposed to run.
