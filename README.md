# Session_3_Lists_and_Loops

In this study group we read through the appropriate chapter **(Chapter 4)** in the **Python for Biologist** book.

We then congregate to discuss how we fared in the exercises at the end of the chapter.

Thereafter we go through some additional Theory and Exercises if time permits.

**Launch** the Interactive Jupyter notebook **HERE ->:** (this takes a while to load in your browser, so please be patient)

In order for the interactive notebook above to run all the blocks without errors, you need to make sure that the files that are used, are stored in the appropriate directories. 
So save a copy of the **dna.txt**, **genomic_dna.txt** and the **input.txt** files on your personal Desktop. 
Also change the file path to your OWN file path. E.g. /home/Cathy_Jones/Desktop, in every block where this file is supposed to run.
